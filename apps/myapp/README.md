The problem with passing all edge data to one point is large memory requirement. 
So when merging the results of two edges I can do some operation there.
This idea leads to the reduction in memory usage on each vertex. 

I get this idea from kd-tree tutorial by Standford assignment 3 [here][1].
The bounded priority queue.
